# Wavesurfer.js AudioStretch
An simple application in javascript to bring audio timestretching to the web. The heavylifting parts are all done in other projects (wavesurfer.js, wavesjs, reverbjs, phasecoderjs), this just glues them together in a userfriendly way (i hope). 

Try it out: [DEMO](http://mdahlgrengadd.github.io)
